# OBJECT-DETECTION-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING
Real time object detection may be a huge, spirited and sophisticated space of computer vision. 
If there may be a single object to be detected in a picture, it's called Image Localization and if there are multiple objects in a picture, then it's Object Detection. 
This detects the semantic objects of a category in digital images and videos. 
The applications of real time object detection include tracking objects, video surveillance, pedestrian detection, folks count, self-driving cars, face detection, ball tracking in sports and plenty of additional. 
Convolution Neural Networks may be a representative tool of Deep learning to find objects victimisation OpenCV(Opensource computer Vision), that may be a library of programming functions mainly geared toward Realtime computer vision.
